### :wave: Hey! I am Valerian.

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Product Designer**. I spend my time building things.

_What I am working on:_

- I am currently CTO at [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/), a customer support SaaS, that I co-founded with [Baptiste Jamin](https://github.com/baptistejamin).
- On the side, I am also working on [Prose](https://prose.org/), a decentralized team messaging app, powered by [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/).
- I have a [personal website](https://valeriansaliou.name/), on which I sometimes [blog](https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/), publish my [projects](https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/projects/) and list [books](https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/books/) I have read.
- I maintain popular OSS projects: [Sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic) (_search index_), [Vigil](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/vigil) (_status page_), [Sales Tax](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/node-sales-tax) (_VAT calculator_), and [more](https://github.com/valeriansaliou?tab=repositories).
- Oh, and one last thing: I co-invented [MakAir](https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/makair-series-the-inception-of-an-open-source-ventilator-project/), the world's first open-source medical ventilator.

_What I am interested in:_

- My domains of expertise are: messaging, protocols, cryptography, the XMPP standard, Rust programming, JavaScript full-stack development, application design, distributed systems, microservices and fault-tolerant architectures.
- On my spare time, I also like to learn about: economics, 3D printing and CAD modeling.
