### ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I am Valerian.

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Product Designer**. I spend my time building things.

- I am currently CTO at [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/), a customer support SaaS, that I co-founded with [Baptiste Jamin](https://github.com/baptistejamin).
- On the side, I am also working on [Prose](https://prose.org/), a decentralized team messaging app, powered by [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/).
- I have a [personal website](https://valeriansaliou.name/), on which I sometimes blog, publish pictures and list books I have read.
- I maintain popular open-source projects, such as: [sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic) (search index), [vigil](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/vigil) (status page), [node-sales-tax](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/node-sales-tax) (VAT calculator) [and more](https://github.com/valeriansaliou?tab=repositories).
- Oh, and one last thing: I co-invented [MakAir](https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/makair-series-the-inception-of-an-open-source-ventilator-project/), the world's first open-source medical ventilator.
