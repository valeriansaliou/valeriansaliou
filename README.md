### Hey! I am Valerian Saliou.

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Product Designer**. I spend my time building things.

- I am currently CTO at [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/), that I co-founded with [Baptiste Jamin](https://github.com/baptistejamin).
- I am also working on [Prose](https://prose.org/), a decentralized team messaging app, powered by [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/).
- Oh, and lastly, I co-invented [MakAir](https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/makair-series-the-inception-of-an-open-source-ventilator-project/), the world's first open-source medical ventilator.
